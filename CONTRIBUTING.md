# Contributing to UDP Packet Generator

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
Here you will find guidelines for reporting bugs, suggesting features, and submitting pull requests.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/UdpPacketGenerator/UdpPacketGenerator/issues/new) and include:

- application version (or release tag)
- operating system
- steps to reproduce
- expected vs actual behavior
- if possible, attach the JSON template that triggers the issue

## Feature Requests

Ideas and suggestions are welcome as well. Open an issue describing what you would like to add and why it would be useful. We can then discuss the technical implementation.

## Adding JSON Templates

We welcome JSON templates for popular protocols or test scenarios (Modbus, NMEA, telemetry, etc.).  
To contribute a template:

1. Place the `.json` file in the [`templates/`](templates/) folder.
2. Make sure the template follows the [Template guide](templates/README.md).
3. If applicable, add a short description to `templates/README.md` (and `templates/README_RU.md`) and/or a usage example.
4. Submit a Pull Request targeting the `dev` branch.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `dev` with a descriptive name (`fix-crash-empty-payload`, `feature/ascii-support`).
2. Make your changes, following the code style described below.
3. Ensure the project compiles without errors (CMake, Qt 6.8+, C++17).
4. If you add a new feature, consider adding tests or an example template.
5. Open a Pull Request to `dev` with a clear description of the changes.
6. Your PR will be reviewed, and changes may be requested.

```
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b fix-crash-empty-payload   # or feature/your-feature-name
```

>⚠️ Important: All changes must be based on the `dev` branch, not on `main`. `main` is reserved for stable releases and does not accept new features directly.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "initial"
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    commit id: "dev start"
    branch feature/ascii-support
    checkout feature/ascii-support
    commit id: "add ascii"
    commit id: "fix tests"
    checkout dev
    merge feature/ascii-support id: "merge feature"
    checkout main
    merge dev id: "release v2.3.0" tag: "v2.3.0"
```

## Code Style

- **C++17**, Qt 6 (Widgets)
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Project provides a `.clang-format` file in the root directory.  
  Use [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) with this configuration for automatic formatting.
- Comments are appreciated, especially for non-obvious logic.
